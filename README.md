# COVID19TweetsDataAnalyzer

![README_Image](Images/README_Image.jpg)

This project is designed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on Twitter usage in the state of North Carolina.  

## Description

The team hypothesizes that twitter references to COVID-19 are positively correlated with the progression of the virus.  
Is that consistent with Twitter COVID-19  references in North Carolina. By leveraging data sources for both Twitter and COVID-19 the team plans to answer the following:   

* Are references to COVID-19 on Twitter positively correlated with the virus progression in North Carolina?
* Does location impact the probability of Twitter use as the virus progressed?
* As the number of cases and deaths increased, did Twitter original Tweets increase. 
* As the number of cases and deaths increased, did Twitter retweets increase.  
* Is North Carolina a good representation of US COVID-19 trends and what thereby can be inferred about Twitter usage.
